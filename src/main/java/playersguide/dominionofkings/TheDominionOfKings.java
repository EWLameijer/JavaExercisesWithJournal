/*
Three kings, Melik, Casik, and Balik, are sitting around a table, debating who has the
greatest kingdom among them. Each king rules an assortment of provinces, duchies, and
estates. Collectively, they agree to a point system that helps them judge whose
kingdom is greatest: Every estate is worth 1 point, every duchy is worth 3 points, and
every province is worth 6 points. They just need a program that will allow them to
enter their current holdings and compute a point total.
Objectives:
Create a program that allows users to enter how many provinces, duchies, and
estates they have.
Add up the userâ€™s total score, giving 1 point per estate, 3 per duchy, and 6
per province.
Display the point total to the user.
